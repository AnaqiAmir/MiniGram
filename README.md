## Limitations
The primary limitation of this project lies in the nature of the data, as it is based on synthetic data rather than real-world user interactions. As a result, the findings of this report may not perfectly mirror actual user behavior on social media platforms. However, the objective of this report is to analyze the unique dynamics of MiniGram's ecosystem. Therefore, it should be viewed as an analysis specific to this application, rather than a comprehensive reflection of broader social media trends.

Another limitation with this report is that an influencer is defined as someone within the top 5 in terms of the number of followers that they have. A better definition of an influencer that can be used in the future is probably a combination of their follower-to-following ratios, the amount likes on their posts, and other factors as well.
